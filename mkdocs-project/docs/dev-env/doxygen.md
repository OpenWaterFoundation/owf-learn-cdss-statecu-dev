# Development Environment / Doxygen

Doxygen is a software tool for generating documentation from code comments.
This eliminates the need to create code documentation outside of code.
Doxygen also creates diagrams that illustrates how code modules call each other.
See the following resources:

* [Doxygen website](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
* [Doxygen download page](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html)
